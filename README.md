### Reflection Section

As someone who has learned everything related to web development on the go, it was refreshing to go back to basics in a structured way. I have used HTML and CSS before, but going through this project has still been a valuable learning experience. It introduced me to semantic HTML. Furthermore, it highlighted the amount of progress I have to make with CSS. Overall, despite the simplicity of the website, a number of core gaps were filled.
